# Calibre Database Import - Complete Integration Guide

## üöÄ Revolutionary New Feature: Import Existing Calibre Library

We've implemented comprehensive Calibre database import functionality that allows you to maintain perfect **lock-step synchronization** between your existing Calibre library and beets. This solves the major challenge of integrating beets with an established Calibre collection.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Import from Calibre Database** (`import-from-calibre`)
- Imports all books from your existing Calibre library into beets
- Beets tracks Calibre-managed files directly (no duplication)
- Preserves all existing Calibre organization and metadata
- Perfect for users with established Calibre libraries

### 2. **Bidirectional Sync** (`bidirectional-sync`) 
- Complete synchronization in both directions
- Books in Calibre ‚Üí imported to beets
- Books in beets ‚Üí imported to Calibre  
- Creates unified library with best of both systems

### 3. **Reverse Sync** (`reverse-sync`)
- Import from Calibre to beets only
- Maintains Calibre as the primary library
- Beets follows Calibre's lead
- Perfect for Calibre-first workflows

## üî• Benefits

### **Lock-Step Synchronization**
- ‚úÖ **No file duplication** - beets tracks Calibre's actual files
- ‚úÖ **Preserves existing organization** - your Calibre structure stays intact
- ‚úÖ **Unified metadata** - combines beets' powerful search with Calibre's management
- ‚úÖ **Bidirectional harmony** - both tools work together seamlessly

### **Workflow Flexibility**
- üéõÔ∏è **Calibre-first**: Import existing Calibre library to beets
- üîÑ **Beets-first**: Use existing workflows like `organize-then-import`
- ‚ö° **Revolutionary**: Try `calibre-takes-control` for ultimate efficiency
- üîÄ **Balanced**: Use `bidirectional-sync` for complete integration

## üìã Command Reference

### Basic Import Commands
```bash
# Import existing Calibre library to beets (dry run)
ebook-manager import-from-calibre --dry-run

# Import existing Calibre library to beets (actual import)
ebook-manager import-from-calibre

# Reverse sync: Calibre ‚Üí beets only
ebook-manager reverse-sync

# Complete bidirectional sync
ebook-manager bidirectional-sync --dry-run
ebook-manager bidirectional-sync
```

### Workflow Commands
```bash
# Revolutionary: Calibre manages files, beets tracks them
ebook-manager calibre-takes-control /path/to/books --dry-run

# Recommended: Organize with beets first, then import to Calibre  
ebook-manager organize-then-import /path/to/books

# Traditional: Import to both libraries separately
ebook-manager dual-import /path/to/books
```

### Maintenance Commands
```bash
# Sync Calibre database with current beets state
ebook-manager sync-calibre

# Check integration configuration
ebook-manager check-calibre-config
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Existing Calibre User**
You have a large, well-organized Calibre library and want to add beets functionality:

```bash
# Step 1: Import your existing Calibre library
ebook-manager import-from-calibre

# Step 2: Now both tools work with the same files
# - Use beets for powerful queries and metadata management
# - Use Calibre for reading and file management
# - Perfect harmony!
```

### **Scenario 2: Fresh Start with Both Tools**
You're setting up both tools for the first time:

```bash
# Use the revolutionary workflow
ebook-manager calibre-takes-control /path/to/new/books

# Or the recommended workflow  
ebook-manager organize-then-import /path/to/new/books
```

### **Scenario 3: Ongoing Synchronization**
You want to keep libraries synchronized as you add new books:

```bash
# Add new books to either system, then sync
ebook-manager bidirectional-sync

# Or maintain Calibre as primary with periodic updates
ebook-manager reverse-sync
```

## üß™ Dry Run Testing

All destructive operations support `--dry-run` for safe testing:

```bash
# Test what would happen without making changes
ebook-manager import-from-calibre --dry-run
ebook-manager calibre-takes-control /books --dry-run  
ebook-manager bidirectional-sync --dry-run
```

## ‚ö° Advanced Integration

### **Lock-Step Architecture**
The integration creates a unique architecture where:

1. **Calibre manages physical files** - handles storage, organization, reading
2. **Beets tracks those files** - provides metadata search, queries, tagging
3. **No duplication** - single source of files with dual access
4. **Bidirectional updates** - changes in either system can sync to the other

### **Metadata Harmony**
- Calibre's rich metadata (covers, descriptions, ratings) is preserved
- Beets' powerful query system works on Calibre's files
- Custom tags and fields can be synchronized between systems
- Both tools see the same underlying collection

### **Future-Proof Design**
- Architecture supports new features in both tools
- Sync capabilities can be extended for other metadata fields
- Framework supports custom integration workflows
- Designed for long-term library management

## üéâ Conclusion

This implementation solves the long-standing challenge of Calibre + beets integration. Whether you're a Calibre veteran wanting beets' power, a beets user wanting Calibre's features, or starting fresh with both, these tools provide the perfect foundation for a unified digital library.

**The result: One library, two powerful interfaces, zero compromises.**
